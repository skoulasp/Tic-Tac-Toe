# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe project! This project is part of my portfolio and was created to practice my web development skills.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks (either "X" or "O").

## Features

- Responsive design: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Dynamic gameplay: Players can take turns marking spaces by clicking on them.
- Win detection: The game detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a tie.
- Restart option: Players can restart the game at any time to play again.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the game board and user interface.
- CSS: Styling to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the game.
- JavaScript: Logic and functionality to enable gameplay and win detection.
